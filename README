= inherit_views

This plugin allows your controllers to inherit their views from parent controllers.  The default behaviour is to inherit along the ancestor path of the controller, but you can also specify custom inherit view paths to search.

NOTE: this plugin is not aimed at having multiple view paths for your controllers, which is addressed with the view_paths addition to ActionController::Base for rails 2.0.  Rather, within these view paths, you can inherit views from other controller paths.

Example:

  class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
    inherit_views
  end

  class FooController < ApplicationController
    # will look for views in 'views/foo', then 'views/application'
  end

  class BarController < FooController
    # will look for views in 'views/bar', then 'views/foo', then 'view/application'
  end

You can also render the parent view in your views with
  <%= render_parent %>

=== Specs and Coverage
* {SPECDOC}[link:files/SPECDOC.html] lists the specifications
* {RSpec Report}[link:rspec_report.html] is a report of spec pass/fails
* {RCov Report}[link:coverage/index.html] is the rcov report

=== Dependencies
* <tt>RCov</tt>               To install do: <tt>gem install rcov</tt>
* <tt>RSpec</tt>              To install do: <tt>gem install rspec</tt>
* <tt>rspec rails plugin</tt> see http://rspec.rubyforge.org/documentation/rails/install.html

=== Testing
RSpec is used for testing, so the tests are in <tt>spec/</tt> rather than
<tt>test/</tt> To run the tests you need a test database set up,
edit <tt>spec/database.yml</tt> to provide the details.

=== Rake tasks
The following tasks are defined:

* <tt>rspec</tt>      (the default task) run the specs
* <tt>rcov</tt>       generate a coverage report (in doc/coverage)
* <tt>rspec_rdoc</tt> generate an rdoc formatted spec doc (in SPECDOC)
* <tt>rspec_rep</tt>  generate a html report of passing/failing test cases (in doc/rspec_report.html)
* <tt>rdoc</tt>       generate the docs, (including SPECDOC)
* <tt>rdoc_all</tt>   generate all documentation including coverage and rspec report
