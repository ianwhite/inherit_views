FirstController class (a controller with: inherit_views)
- should inherit_views
- should have inherit view paths == ['first']

FirstController
- should inherit_views
- should have inherit view paths == ['first']

FirstController views
- should render contents of 'first/in_all' when rendering 'first/in_all
- should raise error when rendering second/in_first, as 'second' is not in inherit_view_paths
- should raise error when rendering first/not_there, as the file 'not_there' is not present

SecondController class (a controller with: inherit_views 'first')
- should inherit_views
- should have inherit view paths == ['second', 'first']

SecondController
- should inherit_views
- should have inherit view paths == ['second', 'first']

SecondController actions
- should render first/in_first when GETing :in_first
- should render second/in_second when GETing :in_second

SecondController views
- should render contents of 'first/in_first' when rendering 'second/in_first
- should render contents of 'second/in_first_and_second' when rendering 'second/in_first_and_second
- should render contents of 'second/in_all' when rendering 'second/in_all
- should render parent views when <%= render_parent %> is in the view
- should raise error when rendering third/in_second, as 'third' is not in inherit_view_paths
- should raise error when rendering second/not_there, as the file 'not_there' is not present

ThirdController class (a controller inheriting from SecondController)
- should inherit_views
- should have inherit view paths == ['third', 'second', 'first']

ThirdController
- should inherit_views
- should have inherit view paths == ['third', 'first']

ThirdController actions
- should render first/in_first when GETing :in_first
- should render second/in_second when GETing :in_second
- should render third/in_third when GETing :in_third

ThirdController views
- should render contents of 'first/in_first' when rendering 'third/in_first
- should render contents of 'second/in_second' when rendering 'third/in_second
- should render contents of 'second/in_first_and_second' when rendering 'third/in_first_and_second
- should render contents of 'third/in_all' when rendering 'third/in_all
- should render parent views when <%= render_parent %> is in the view
- should raise error when rendering fourth/in_third, as 'fourth' is not in inherit_view_paths
- should raise error when rendering third/not_there, as the file 'not_there' is not present

ThirdController#find_inherited_template_path
- should return first/in_first for third/in_first
- should return second/in_second for third/in_second
- should return third/in_all for third/in_all
- should return nil for third/not_there
- should return nil for fourth/in_third

ActionView#render_parent
- should render the parent view of @current_render when render_parent called
- should raise ArgunmentError if called when controller.inherit_views? is false
- should raise InheritedFileNotFound error if there is no parent view

ActionView#inherited_template_path
- should return third/in_second when called with second/in_second (without controller class)
- should return nil when called with third/in_second (with controller class specified as FirstController)

InheritViews controllers in production mode
- should have inherited_template_paths_cache
- should cache calls to find_inherited_template_path
- should maintain different caches in different classes
